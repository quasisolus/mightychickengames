# Mighty Chicken Unblocked Games

This project marks the creation of my first-ever website. I embarked on this journey in late August 2024 intending to develop a school-friendly unblocked games website. Although it was not intended for actual use, the primary objective was to gain knowledge. You can access the website here: https://mightychickengames.vercel.app/.

## Lessons Learned

**What did I learn while building this project?**

Throughout this project, I acquired a wealth of knowledge. These included:
- Basics and intermediate levels of HTML
- Understanding of semantics and accessibility basics
- Forms and basic CSS

I learned all of this within a span of two weeks using Mimo Code, a mobile app tailored for new developers seeking to learn a new hobby or pursuing a career in coding.
