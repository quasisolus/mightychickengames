# Mighty Chicken Unblocked Games

This project was the first website I've ever made. I began this project in late August 2024 with the project's aim being towards creating a school unblocked games website, however, it wasn't ever fully intended to be used, but rather a project to gain knowledge. The website can be accessed here: https://snoozyyxv.github.io/mightychickengames/
## Lessons Learned

_What did I learn while building this project?_

I learned many things during this project. These include the basics and intermediate level of HTML, semantics, accessibility basics, forms, and basic CSS. I learned this all through the span of two weeks using Mimo Code, a mobile app aimed at new developers looking to learn a new hobby or to find a career in coding.
