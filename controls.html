        <p>Remember that if you'd like to leave a game, you must press the back arrow in your browser. If you'd like to retry one of the games, just refresh. Make sure you try to use
            the arrow keys and WASD if needed. If this isn't the case then just try all of your keys on your keyboard to find the controls.</p>
